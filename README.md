## Introduction

This project addresses forecasting sales for different time intervals:

- Next week  
- Next month  
- Next quarter/season  

The ultimate goal is to achieve prediction confidence between *80-90%*.

### Applications

- *Inventory Management*  
- *Revenue Forecasting*  
- *Resource Allocation*  
- *Seasonal Planning*

## Features

1. Forecasting sales for bakery categories.  
2. Visualizing seasonal trends and residuals.  
3. Enhanced accuracy through weather-based feature integration.  
4. Streamlit-based frontend app for easy inference.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:  
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sales-predictions.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   bash
   cd sales-predictions
   
3. Install the required dependencies:  
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Prepare the data by digitizing records from physical files.  
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, sort data, etc.).  
3. Train the models (SARIMA, Random Forest, etc.).  
4. Launch the Streamlit app for live predictions:  
   bash
   streamlit run app.py

## Future Goals/Roadmap

1. Explore deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers for time-series forecasting.  
2. Build an interactive dashboard for scenario visualization.  
3. Incorporate external variables (e.g., holidays, promotions).  
4. Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost and neural networks.  
5. Automate parameter tuning using grid search or Bayesian optimization.
