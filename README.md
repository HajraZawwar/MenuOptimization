# Sales Predictions for Bakery Item Categories

---

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting sales for various bakery item categories, enabling improved inventory management, revenue forecasting, and resource allocation. It uses machine learning models, including SARIMA and Random Forest Regressor, to forecast sales and enhance decision-making processes.

Key objectives include:

- Predicting sales for the next week, month, and quarter/season.  
- Achieving a prediction confidence of **80-90%**.

Applications:

- **Inventory Management**  
- **Revenue Forecasting**  
- **Resource Allocation**  
- **Seasonal Planning**
